    Pre-Trial Memo for pro-se litigant
  description: |-
    A pre-trial memorandum is a document that you will present to the judge at your pre-trial conference. This is an opportunity for you to discuss settlement, establish a deadline for discovery, address any motions that have been filed, resolve any discovery disputes, and determine if your case is ready to go to trial. 
    
    The pre-trial memorandum is the document that will show the judge your position on the things you and your spouse disagree about and how prepared you are for trial. This is not your only opportunity, but an important one!

  How the judge will decide your case.
subquestion: |
  The judge will use different sections under chapter 208 of the Massachusetts General Law to decide your case. Based on any contested issues of fact (which you will enter soon), the judge will use the factors in the law to weigh each issue and decide your case from there. These factors include but are not limited to: the length of the marriage, the conduct of both parties during the marriage, and other similar facts which will be discussed later.
